# Guigui (ぐいぐい)

**An immediate-mode-like GUI framework for Go**

**This project is an alpha version, and everything may change in the future.**

**Except for minor changes like typo fixes, we have not yet established a development policy for accepting changes. For new widgets, please make your proposal in [Discussion](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/guigui/discussions/13).**

 * Pure Go implementation without any use of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript
 * Hi-DPI support for clear visuals on modern displays
 * Built-in internationalization (I18N) support for multiple languages
 * Efficient rendering with optimized draw calls for better performance
